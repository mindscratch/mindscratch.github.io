I am Craig Wickesser and I write code for fun and for [makin' paper](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Makin%27+Paper). I've [contributed
code](https://osrc.dfm.io/mindscratch/) to various open source projects using
a variety of programming languages, though I tend to prefer Go for server-side projects.

I was an editor for [jsmag](http://www.jsmag.com/) and [GroovyMag](http://groovymag.com/), but I have also written articles for [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/author/Craig-Wickesser), [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/cwickesser/) and [GroovyMag](http://www.groovymag.com/authors).

As [Zed Shaw](http://zedshaw.com/about/) says,

> I block comments on my writing because I believe you should go say what you think of my words on your own site instead of shitting all over mine.
