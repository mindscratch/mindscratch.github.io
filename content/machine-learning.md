Machine Learning is a topic that I've been interested in for years, but have
never taken the time to learn. I've recently found some articles and projects
that looked interesting, which I link to later. But before I really jump into
any of those I thought I should start at the beginning with an introduction
to machine learning.

The [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course
taught by [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/) seems to be the seminal course.
I also found [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) available
on Udacity is taught by [Sebastian Thrun](http://robots.stanford.edu/) and [Katie Malone](https://twitter.com/multiarmbandit).

I decided to try out the Udacity course since I've never really tried their courses before.

Here are links to articles, blog posts and projects that look interesting:

* [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/2016/11/06/tutorial-1/)
* [ML-From-Scratch](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch)
* [Awesome Deep Learning Papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)
* [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
* [Gentlest Introduction to TensorFlow](https://medium.com/all-of-us-are-belong-to-machines/the-gentlest-introduction-to-tensorflow-248dc871a224#.il98kd2r1)

My plan is to update this page from time to time with notes and my status on my
journey to grokking Machine Learning.
