I recently had a situation where an application I was working on in [Go](http://golang.org) would
run into the "too many open files" error. After some debugging, I discovered
it wasn't closing HTTP connections being made to an HTTP server.

**Update**: It turns out, I was testing against "test" server which wasn't
setting the `Connection: close` header, therefore neither the client or
server was requesting the connection to be closed. If the server had set the
`Connection` header, things would've been fine.

The code looked like this:

```go
  transport := &http.Transport {
    Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
    Dial: (&net.Dialer{
      Timeout: 0,
      KeepAlive: 0
    }).Dial,
    TLSHandshakeTimeout: 10 * time.second
  }

  httpClient := &http.Client{Transport: transport}

  function submitData(url string, fileReader io.Reader) error {
    req, reqErr := http.NewRequest("POST", url, fileReader)
    if reqErr != nil {
      return reqErr
    }
    req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream")

    resp, err := httpClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
      return err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // read the body

    return nil
  }
```

The `submitData` function gets called over and over whenever new data needs to
be POSTed. Using [netstat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstat) I noticed the
connections to the server were staying `ESTABLISHED` instead of being closed. I
set the "timeout" on the dialer to 0, because the POST should block until the
server is done and responds (which is an undetermined amount of time).

I know the server is responding, because the code that processes the response
was in fact getting data.

It turns out, HTTP/1.1 uses persistent connections by default:

> A significant difference between HTTP/1.1 and earlier versions of HTTP is that persistent connections are the default behavior of any HTTP connection.

<cite>http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html</cite>

The solution was to inform the server that the client wants to close the connection
after the transaction is complete. This can be done by setting the [Connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection)
header,

```
req.Header.Set("Connection", "close")
```

or by setting the `Close` property to `true` on the [http.Request](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request):

```
req.Close = true
```

After doing that, the "too many open files" issue went away as the program was
no longer keeping HTTP connections open and thus not using up file descriptors.
