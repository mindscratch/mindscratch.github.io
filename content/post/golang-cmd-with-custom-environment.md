Problem: Execute an external process with a customized environment.

Solution: The [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com) site
has as an example demonstrating how to [spawn an external process](https://gobyexample.com/spawning-processes) and how [exec
a process](https://gobyexample.com/execing-processes). Those two examples provide
a great starting point. Below, we'll take it a step further to modify the
environment.
