      <description>In trying to keep the tradition of posting a year in review, so here it goes.
Programming This year I worked a couple of different projects. I continued to work on a LAMP stack app which used Angular 1.x for its frontend. I also developed a web based application to assist in monitoring local government, built with VueJS, Go, Elasticsearch, Amazon SQS, RDS and SES.
I also continued working on the next generation of a backend processing system that uses Docker + Mesos, with the goal of simplifying the archtiecture, development, deployment and maintenance.</description>
