      <description>I recently had a situation where an application I was working on in Go would run into the &amp;ldquo;too many open files&amp;rdquo; error. After some debugging, I discovered it wasn&amp;rsquo;t closing HTTP connections being made to an HTTP server.
Update: It turns out, I was testing against &amp;ldquo;test&amp;rdquo; server which wasn&amp;rsquo;t setting the Connection: close header, therefore neither the client or server was requesting the connection to be closed. If the server had set the Connection header, things would&amp;rsquo;ve been fine.</description>
